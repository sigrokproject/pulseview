.TH PULSEVIEW 1 "July 31, 2019"
.SH "NAME"
PulseView \- Qt-based LA/scope/MSO GUI for sigrok
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B pulseview \fR[\fBOPTIONS\fR] [\fBFILE\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B PulseView
is a cross-platform Qt-based GUI for the
.B sigrok
software suite for test and measurement equipment such as logic analyzers,
oscilloscopes, MSOs, and more.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.B PulseView
has very few command line options, as most configuration elements are
available from the GUI itself.
.sp
If the optional \fBFILE\fR argument is supplied, PulseView tries to open
the specified file. It has to be in the "libsigrok session" format (.sr)
unless -I is used to specify the input file format.
.TP
.B "\-l, \-\-loglevel"
Set the libsigrok and libsigrokdecode loglevel. At the moment PulseView
doesn't support setting the two loglevels independently. The higher the
number, the more debug output will be printed. Valid loglevels are:
.sp
\fB0\fP   None
.br
\fB1\fP   Error
.br
\fB2\fP   Warnings
.br
\fB3\fP   Informational
.br
\fB4\fP   Debug
.br
\fB5\fP   Spew
.TP
.B "\-h, \-?, \-\-help"
Show a help text and exit.
.TP
.B "\-V, \-\-version"
Show version information and exit.
.TP
.BR "\-d, \-\-driver " <drivername>
Specify the capture device to connect to. If the
.B \-\-driver
option is not supplied, PulseView attempts to re-connect to the
most recently used device, or auto-detect available devices.
.TP
.BR "\-D, \-\-dont\-scan "
Usually PulseView automatically scans all drivers to find suitable
devices during program startup. This option disables the auto-scan.
Users can either specify the
.B \-\-driver
option to pick a device at startup, or interactively scan for devices
after PulseView has finished starting up.
.TP
.BR "\-i, \-\-input\-file " <filename>
Load input from a file. If the
.B \-\-input\-format
option is not supplied, PulseView attempts to load the file as a sigrok session
file.
.TP
.BR "\-I, \-\-input\-format " <format>
Specifies the format of the input file to be loaded.
.TP
.BR "\-s, \-\-settings " <filename>
Load PulseView session setup to use with the input file. The setup file must be
in the "PulseView session setup" format (.pvs).
.TP
.BR "\-c, \-\-clean"
Prevents the previously used sessions to be restored from settings storage.
This is useful if you want only a single session with the file given on the
command line instead of restoring all previously used sessions as well.
