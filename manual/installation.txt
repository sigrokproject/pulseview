== Installation

PulseView can be run on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X or Android. For some platforms, we provide binary
packages, for others we provide installers and for others we provide AppImage containers that
you can run without the need to install anything. Check the https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads[sigrok download page]
to see which option is available for your platform.

=== Linux

On Linux, the usual way to install PulseView is to install the packages provided by your distro's
package manager. However, sometimes only outdated packages are made available to you. In that case,
you have two options:

. https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads[Download] and use the AppImage which contains all required files and needs no installation:
+
--
[listing, subs="normal"]
chmod u+x PulseView-NIGHTLY-x86_64.AppImage
./PulseView-NIGHTLY-x86_64.AppImage

Please be aware, however, that the AppImages are built every night, so they always contain
the latest development changes. While we do try to keep the code base in a working state, it is sometimes
unavoidable to introduce bugs that show up in the nightly builds. If you encounter something that is
odd to you, please download and install the latest nightly and check if the issue still exists. If it
does, feel free to https://sigrok.org/bugzilla/[file a bug].

No system files are changed, so if you decide that you no longer want to use PulseView, simply
delete the AppImage. If you also want the stored settings gone, delete ~/.config/sigrok as well.
--

. Uninstall any sigrok packages from your package manager and build PulseView from source:
+
--
[listing, subs="normal"]
_[install dependencies https://sigrok.org/wiki/Linux#Building[as listed on the wiki]]_
mkdir ~/sr
cd ~/sr
wget -O sigrok-cross-linux 'https://sigrok.org/gitweb/?p=sigrok-util.git;a=blob_plain;f=cross-compile/linux/sigrok-cross-linux'
chmod u+x sigrok-cross-linux
./sigrok-cross-linux
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/sr/lib
~/sr/bin/pulseview

No system files are changed, so if you decide that you no longer want to use PulseView, simply
delete the ~/sr directory. If you also want the stored settings gone, delete ~/.config/sigrok
as well.

[WARNING]
--
If you don't install the PulseView distro packages (as is the case when using the AppImage or building
from source), PulseView will not be able to access USB and serial port devices unless it's run as root.
Since programs shouldn't be run as root unless absolutely necessary, we provide udev configuration files
that allows PulseView access to those devices without being root.

Here's how you install them:
[listing, subs="normal"]
sudo bash
cd /etc/udev/rules.d/
wget -O 60-libsigrok.rules 'https://sigrok.org/gitweb/?p=libsigrok.git;a=blob_plain;f=contrib/60-libsigrok.rules'
wget -O 61-libsigrok-plugdev.rules 'https://sigrok.org/gitweb/?p=libsigrok.git;a=blob_plain;f=contrib/61-libsigrok-plugdev.rules'
wget -O 61-libsigrok-uaccess.rules 'https://sigrok.org/gitweb/?p=libsigrok.git;a=blob_plain;f=contrib/61-libsigrok-uaccess.rules'
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
--

=== Windows

We offer installers for PulseView that contain everything you need to get started. Simply download
them from the https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads[sigrok download page] and run them as any other Windows
installer.
Please be aware, however, that the Windows installers are built every night, so they always contain
the latest development changes. While we do try to keep the code base in a working state, it is sometimes
unavoidable to introduce bugs that show up in the nightly builds. If you encounter something that is
odd to you, please download and install the latest nightly and check if the issue still exists. If it
does, feel free to https://sigrok.org/bugzilla/[file a bug].

After installation, you will find a program called Zadig in the start menu. By default, certain devices
recognized by Windows will have drivers installed for them that PulseView cannot use. The purpose of
Zadig is to let you change the driver Windows uses for a particular device - for most devices you'll need
to choose WinUSB to use them with PulseView or the original proprietary Windows driver to use it with whatever
other software you access the device with. More details are available https://sigrok.org/wiki/Windows[in the wiki].

In case your device doesn't show up in PulseView and you can't find it with a scan either (see next
chapter), check with Zadig whether the correct driver is assigned for the device.

=== Mac OS X

We offer DMG installers for PulseView that contain everything you need to get started. Simply download
them from the https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads[sigrok download page] and run them.

Please be aware, however, that the DMG installers are built every night, so they always contain
the latest development changes. While we do try to keep the code base in a working state, it is sometimes
unavoidable to introduce bugs that show up in the nightly builds. If you encounter something that is
odd to you, please download and install the latest nightly and check if the issue still exists. If it
does, feel free to https://sigrok.org/bugzilla/[file a bug].

No system files are changed, so if you decide that you no longer want to use PulseView, simply
delete the DMG file. If you also want the stored settings gone, delete
~/Library/Preferences/pulseview.plist as well.
