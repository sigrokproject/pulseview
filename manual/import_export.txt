== Data Import/Export

In order to facilitate versatile use of the sigrok suite, libsigrok allows users to import
and export data from files in various formats - some of them as generic as possible, others
very specific. For a list and details, make sure to check https://sigrok.org/wiki/Input_output_formats[the wiki].

=== Import

The first step to importing data from a file is to know what format the data in the file is
encoded in. There are common, not-so-common and outright exotic ways to represent data and sigrok
tries to suit as many needs as it can. To see which formats your version of PulseView supports,
just click on the small arrow next to the _Open_ button:

After choosing the format that you want to use, PulseView will ask for the file name to open.
Once you picked the file, you may be asked to specify the details of the format, if the input
module requires them.

For example, the VCD import will ask you for these:

* Compress idle periods: Compress idle periods longer than the specified value (default 0)
* Downsampling factor: Downsample, i.e. divide the samplerate by the specified factor (default 1)
* Number of logic channels: The number of (logic) channels in the data (default 0)
* Skip samples until timestamp: Skip samples until the specified timestamp; < 0: Skip until first timestamp listed; 0: Don't skip (default -1)


A click on _Ok_ then loads the data from the selected file and you can work with it.

=== Export

Export works just the same as the import: clicking on the small arrow next to the _Save_ button
brings up the export menu. Simply choose the format you want to use and proceed.
